<h1 id="questionone">What causes greenhouse gases to be emitted?</h1>
  <p>The greenhouse effect is caused by many gases in the atmosphere that trap the heat in the air. Some of the main greenhouse gases are methane, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons. However, the most important greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide.<br> 
    Increased carbon dioxide emissions are caused mainly by the burning of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels include coal, crude oil, and natural gas. Another reason why carbon dioxide is increasing is because of the lack of trees. This is caused by deforestation and wildfires. Trees soak up carbon dioxide and turn it into oxygen during the process of photosynthesis.<br>
    Methane is a very potent greenhouse gas. It is twenty times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. Methane is caused mainly by animal digestion. It’s also caused by the production and distribution of fossil fuels and animal decomposition.<br>
    Nitrous oxide is another greenhouse gas. It is caused by vehicle exhausts and power stations.

    <h1 id="questiontwo">How have greenhouse gas emissions changed over time?</h1>
    
    <button id="buttonone">The greenhouse effect began long before humans even existed!</button>
    <button id="buttontwo">Greenhouse gas emissions have stayed about the same from 1000 A.D. to 1800 A.D.</button>

    <h1 id="questionthree">What are the effects of greenhouse gas emissions?</h1>
  <ul><li>Effects on the Weather</li>
    <ul><li>More Intense and Frequent Extreme weather</li>
    <li>Heavy rainfall and snowfall</li>
    <li>More droughts and fires</li>
    <li>Rising sea levels means more floods</li>
    <li>More frequent and intense heat waves</li></ul>
    <li>Effects on land animals and plants</li>
    <ul><li>Melting polar ice caps</li>
      <ul><li>Polar bears hunt on the polar ice caps</li>
    <li>Seals give birth on the ice</li></ul>
    <li>Faster global warming means it’s harder for animals to adapt to the heat.</li>
    <li>Rising sea levels means the loss of wetlands</li>
    <li>If a warm spring comes sooner,</li>
    <ul><li>Plant blooming,</li>
    <li>Egg laying,</li>
    <li>Migration,</li>
    <li>and new leaves come sooner</li></ul>
    <li>Animals will also be migrating to cooler areas</li>
    <li>Ocean life will suffer</li>
    <ul><li>Warm oceans damage marine ecosystems</li>
    <li>High ocean temperatures cause coral to die.</li></ul></ul>
    <li>Effects on humans</li>
    <ul><li>More heat-related illnesses</li>
    <ul><li>Heat stroke</li>
    <li>Heat cramps</li>
    <li>Heat exhaustion</li></ul>
    <li>More natural disasters means more loss of life and destruction of property.</li></ul>
  </ul>

  <h1 id="questionfour">What can we do to lower greenhouse gas emissions on a household level?</h1>
  
    <ol>
      <li><b>Drive less.</b> Cars burn gas, which is a fossil fuel. The burning of fossil fuels leads to more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. If places are not too far away, you can bike or walk. Taking public transportation is another good option, too. Getting an electric car is even better.
      </li>
      <li><b>Eat less meat.</b> The digestive systems of livestock release methane, which is a very potent greenhouse gas. Try to not eat meat on a few days of the week, for a start. You could also try meat alternatives.
      </li>
      <li><b>Try to reduce the use of spray-on things.</b> For example, hairspray, cooking spray, spray paint, etc. Some of these products contain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which break up ozone and are responsible for the hole in the ozone layer. Many of these products do not contain CFCs anymore, but it’s better safe than sorry.
      </li>
      <li><b>Lower the temperature in your house.</b> That’s right, turn the thermostat down. Fossil fuels, which are an incredibly large factor in carbon dioxide emissions, are used to heat your homes. So turning the heat down can reduce CO2 emissions, even if it’s just a little bit.
      </li>
      <li><b>Get solar panels.</b> Solar panels are a great alternative to powering your house with fossil fuels. There are many other energy alternatives such as wind power, hydropower, and geothermal energy. These are all types of renewable energy, which means that these resources will never run out. However, solar panels are more accessible than these other options. 
      </li>
      <li><b>Use less electricity.</b> Electricity comes from fossil fuels, so if we use less, we can conserve fossil fuels. Turn off devices when you are not using them, and just try not to use them as much. It’s good for the environment and good for you, too.
      </li>
      <li><b>Plant a Tree.</b> Trees soak up carbon dioxide during the process of photosynthesis. That carbon dioxide turns into oxygen. So, more trees equals less carbon dioxide.
      </li>
